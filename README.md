## Overview
This is a simple implementation of a Markov process. The Markov process is a stochastic process that satisfies the Markov property. The Markov property states that the future state of the process depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it. The Markov process is used in various fields such as physics, chemistry, biology, economics, and finance. In this implementation, we will simulate a simple Markov process with two states, state 0 and state 1. The transition matrix of the Markov process is given by:
